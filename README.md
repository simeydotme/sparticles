# installation

Depending on how your project looks, 
- you may want to [include a direct link to the script](#vanilla) and 
then initialise the sparkles,
- or you may want
to [import the module in to your application](#app--bundler) for a more modern approach.

## vanilla

1. firstly make sure you've downloaded [the latest version of the script](https://github.com/simeydotme/sparticles/releases) 
to your application directory _(if you are running on a CMS you might also 
need to upload the file to your server)_. The file you'll want to use is; `dist/sparticles.min.js` 
to make sure it downloads the fastest for your users.

2. After you've downloaded, or uploaded, the `sparticles.min.js` file to the 
correct place, you'll then need to include it in your web page;

```html
<script src="../path/to/sparticles.min.js"></script>
```

3. And finally, you should then be able to initialise the Sparticles by 
running this code in your javascript;  
<sup>_(make sure this code runs _after_ you've included the script above.)_</sup>

```html
<script>
  window.onload = function() {
    let myElement = document.getElementById("myDiv");
    let mySparticles = new Sparticles(myElement, { density: 100 }, 400);
  }
</script>
```

## jquery

For jQuery sites, you may follow all of the steps above, but replace 
the third step with something like below;

```html
<script>
  let $el = $("#myDiv");
  let mySparticles = new Sparticles($el[0], { density: 100 }, 400);
</script>
```

## app / bundler

If you're running a more modern type of application with something like Svelte or VueJs; 

1. First you will want to install the module with NPM;

```bash
yarn add --dev sparticles
# or npm, if you prefer
npm install --save-dev sparticles
```

2. Then import the module in to the app where you want to use it

```js
import Sparticles from "sparticles";
```

3. Finally initialise with vanillaJS

```js
new Sparticles(node, { density: 100 }, 400);
```

4. If you're using SvelteJS specifically, then your single-file component
would look a little like this;

```html
<script>

  import Sparticles from "sparticles";

  let sparticles,
      options = { color: "gold", shape: "star", speed: 50 };

  function addSparticles(node) {
    new Sparticles(node, options, 400);
  }

</script>

<main use:addSparticles>
</main>
```

# usage

Providing that the script/module has been properly included, then it can be initialised
by running the `Sparticles()` constructor;
```js
let mySparticles = new Sparticles();
```

# parameters

When initialising the Sparticles instance there are some parameters that can be supplied.

parameter                   | type               | default            | description
----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
**node**                    | `HTMLElement`      | `document.body`    | the element in the DOM which the Sparticles will append to
**[options](#options)**     | `Object`           | `{}`               | an object with [all the options for the instance](#options)
**width**                   | `Number`           | `node.clientWidth` | the width of the canvas element
**height**                  | `Number`           | `node.clientWidth` | the height of the canvas element (defaults to width)

<sup>Leave the `width`/`height` properties empty to make the canvas resize to fit it's `node`</sup>

---

- Supply nothing and get a default Sparticle instance on the `<body>`
```js
let mySparticles = new Sparticles();
```

- Supply a single HTMLElement parameter for a default Sparticle instance on that element
```js
let mySparticles = new Sparticles(document.getElementById("myDiv"));
```

- Supply a single `Object` parameter to customise a Sparticle instance on the `<body>`
```js
let mySparticles = new Sparticles({ color: "red" });
```

- Supply the width and height parameters for a custom size
```js
let mySparticles = new Sparticles({ color: "red" }, 400, 300);
```

## `composition`
- Type: `String` 
- Default: `source-over`
- Possible: [`see list here`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation)

The [global render composition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation)
when rendering particles on top of one-another. This, however, is a very expensive operation when set to anything
other than the default value (`source-over`), and will ultimately degrade performance, especially with many particles.

Will accept [any of the values that are provided as part of the Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation)

## `density`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `50`
- Range: `1 - 10000`

Density of particles drawn to the screen. Automatically recalculates particles count.
50 is equivalent to 50 on a 1440 x 660 container.
Values over `500` may begin to degrade performance.

## `speed`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `10`
- Range: `0 - 100`

The base value of speed across all particles. This is modified by options such as 
`parallax` and `[x/y]Variance` to determine the final velocity of each individual particle.
A speed of `0` will render particles stationary before applying `[x/y]Variance`.

## `parallax`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `1`
- Range: `0 - 20`

A value to apply more speed to larger particles, and less speed to smaller particles, creating
an effect which makes larger particles appear closer to the screen.

## `direction`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `180`
- Range: `0 - 360`

The base angle (in degrees) at which the particles are travelling, so long as they have a speed value.

## `xVariance`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `2`
- Range: `0 - 20`

How much variance is applied between particles on the `X` axis. A value of `0` will make all particles
appear to be going completely parallel, and look unnatural.

Can be used in conjunction with `speed: 0;` to make particles which float randomly in space.

## `yVariance`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `2`
- Range: `0 - 20`

How much variance is applied between particles on the `Y` axis. A value of `0` will make all particles
appear to be going completely parallel, and look unnatural.

Can be used in conjunction with `speed: 0;` to make particles which float randomly in space.

## `rotate`
- Type: `Boolean`
- Default: `true`

Toggle whether the particles are allowed to spin about their axis.

## `rotation`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `1`
- Range: `0 - 20`

How fast the particles can spin about their axis, this has a random multiplier added per-particle
which prevents a completely unnatural spinning effect.

## `alphaSpeed`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `10`
- Range: `0 - 50`

Rate of change for the alpha value of all particles. A higher value will encourage the particles
to flicker like candle lights. A value of `0` will disable alpha change.

## `alphaVariance`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `2`
- Range: `0 - 10`

How much variance is applied between each particle on the alpha value change over time. A value
of `0` will cause all particles to change alpha at the same rate, a higher value will introduce more
variety.

## `minAlpha`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `0`
- Range: `-5 - +1`

The minimum alpha value a particle can change to. The lower the number the longer it will stay invisible
on the canvas, this could be useful in some scenarios where the particle should fade out for a while.

Must be lower than the `maxAlpha` value.

## `maxAlpha`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `0`
- Range: `0 - +5`

The maximum alpha value a particle can change to. The higher the number the longer it will stay visible
on the canvas, this could be useful in some scenarios where the particle should stay at max alpha for a time.

Must be higher than the `minAlpha` value.

## `minSize`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `1`
- Range: `1 - 100`

Minimum size (in pixels) of the particles. The actual size of each particle is variable between the `minSize`
and `maxSize`. If the `minSize` and `maxSize` are the same value; then all particles will be uniformly sized.

## `maxSize`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `10`
- Range: `1 - 100`

Maximum size (in pixels) of the particles. The actual size of each particle is variable between the `minSize`
and `maxSize`. If the `minSize` and `maxSize` are the same value; then all particles will be uniformly sized.

## `style`
- Type: `String`
- Default: `"fill"`
- Values: `"fill"`, `"stroke"` or `"both"`

Particles can be either stroked (outline) or filled (solid) and this setting determines that style. It's
also possible to randomize the style by choosing `"both"`

## `bounce`
- Type: `Boolean`
- Default: `false`

Determine if particles should bounce off the boundaries of the canvas instead of resetting to the opposite side.
This is best used with `speed: 0;` and a high value for `[x/yVariance]` to create a chaotic effect.

## `drift`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `1`
- Range: `1 - 20`

How much a particle will "drift" as it falls. This is to imply a floatiness/wind effect like seen with snow flakes,
or leaves. The `drift` will only apply if `speed > 0` and `direction` is near to a 90degree value (`0, 90, 180, 270`)

## `glow`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `0`
- Range: `0 - 50`

Glow (or shadow) effect around the particle. This will not affect images.

## `twinkle`
- Type: `Boolean`
- Default: `false`

Apply a "twinkle" effect to the particle when changing alpha. This works best with a higher `alphaSpeed` and 
`alphaVariance` value.

## `color`
- Type: `String` / `Array<String>`
- Default: `"random"`
- Values: any valid css/html color string

A CSS/HTML color string to apply across all particles.  
If an array of colors (`[ "#ff0", "red", "hsl(10,50%,50%)" ]`) is given, then each particle will 
be assigned a random color from the array. Additionally `"random"` can be used to assign any random color.

## `randomColor`
- Type: `Function`
- Default: [`randomHSL()`](https://github.com/simeydotme/sparticles/blob/master/src/helpers.js#L55-L64)
- Arguments: `index`, `total`

Custom function to use when generating `random` colors. The default function will return a fairly
pleasant `hsl()` color with a high saturation and medium lightness. This can be overridden to suit
your environment better. The two arguments (`index`, `total`) are `Integer`s and allow for a little
psuedo-randomizing.

**example:**

```js
randomColor: function( index, total ) {
	return `hsl( ${index}, 80%, ${total - index}% )`;
}
```

## `randomColorCount`
- Type: `Number`
- Default: `3`
- Range: `1 - 50`

How many random colors to generate when `color` is `random`. The more colors generated
the more chance there is of a performance penalty. It should be OK up to `50`.

## `shape`
- Type: `String` / `Array<String>`
- Default: `"circle"`
- Values: `"circle"`, `"square"`, `"triangle"`, `"line"`, `"diamond"`, `"star"` or `"image"`

Determine the shape of all the particles.  
If an array of shapes (`[ "circle", "star", "diamond" ]`) is given, then each particle will
be assigned a random shape form the array. Additionally `"image"` can be used to [define a custom
particle shape from an image when combined with `imageUrl`](#imageUrl).

## `imageUrl`
- Type: `String` / `Array<String>`
- Default: `""`
- Values: a valid url, or data-uri

Determine the custom image to be used for all the particles.
If an array of urls (`[ "http://my.image/shape.png", "http://my.svg/shape.svg" ]`) is given, then each particle
will be assigned a random image as it's shape from the array.
<sup>**This image should be a square (1:1)**</sup>  

- ‚Ñπ `imageUrl` only has an effect [if a `shape` in the array is; `"image"`](#shape).
- ‚Ñπ `imageUrl` can accept **svg**, but the `<svg>` root needs a width/height. [(see issue)](https://github.com/simeydotme/sparticles/issues/2);

# methods

a few public methods can be accessed by storing a reference to the Sparticles instance
and executed like so;

```js
let mySparticles = new Sparticles();
mySparticles.destroy();
```

method                                                   | description
---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------
**[destroy()](#destroy)**                                | destroy the Sparticles instance and remove event listeners
**[setCanvasSize( width, height )](#setCanvasSize)**     | set the new size of the canvas
**[resetSparticles()](#resetSparticles)**                | reset all the particles on the canvas

# styling

If the Sparticles are simply going to be placed in a container (like a `<div>`) then the only
styling that should be necessary is to set the width/height of the canvas [using the 
`width` and `height` parameters](#parameters).

---

To place the Sparticles in the background of a web-page, you'll need to add a
container to the `<body>` which the canvas can sit in, then `position` it `fixed`:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- your html web page content -->
    <div class="sparticles-container"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then we set up the CSS styling for the Sparticles container depending on our
situation:
```css
/** 
  * we need to make sure the background doesn't have a
  * background color as we want to place the container
  * behind it on the z-axis!
  */
html { background: black; }
body { background: transparent; }

.sparticles-container {
  position: fixed;
  left: 0; right: 0;
  top: 0; bottom: 0;
  /**
   * z-index: -1; this makes the <body> still interactive 
   * by placing the sparticles behind the content
   */
  z-index: -1; 
}
/**
* we could a;so use "pointer-events: none;" in
* modern browsers to put the particles on top of all our content
*/
@supports ( pointer-events: none ) {
  .sparticles-container {
    z-index: 2;
    pointer-events: none;
  }
}
```

Finally we can initiate the Sparticles with the `.sparticles-container`
as the DOM element it's bound to:
```js
let container = document.querySelector(".sparticles-container");
let mySparticles = new Sparticles( container, { color: "red" });
// no need for width/height as the  canvas will fill 
// the container which is fixed to the viewport size
```

# performance

Sparticles is really quite fast! 

It was designed to be the smallest (_within reason_) and fastest performing
particles script with such a large feature set! 

Some other popular particle scripts will eat up to 50% of your CPU to 
render 1,000 particles. Sparticles will do the same while only using 9% 
and will run at a buttery 120fps if your device can refresh that fast!

Sparticles was built because other offerings in the space were either 
doing way too much and adding too many `kb` to load, or they were just 
too slow and unable to serve enough particles to lower end devices 
without chugging along jankily! 

I used to get a lot of requests from Editorial/Content teams who wanted
snow/sparkles/whatever on their home page during events, and I either had
to reject because the plugins were killing our user's devices or accept
and live knowing I've failed the users/customers! üò¢ ~~ so Sparticles should fix that!

## mobile

- ‚Ñπ **It's quite easy to achieve 120fps+ with over 1,000 particles on a decent computer!**  

- ‚ö† _But please remember **your users are not all running super-computers** with GPUs, they 
are [**probably on a mobile phone**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/). 
Please avoid running heavy animations on phones! If you really have to then I'd advise reducing the particles down to 100 or less for a mobile device!_

Please take care of your mobile users! They are probably your primary user if you're
running a commercial or non-tech website! use a script like below to determine the amount
of particles based on their device;

```js
  let myElement = document.getElementById("myDiv");
  // PLEASE DON'T PUSH A TON OF ANIMATION ON MOBILES!
  let density = (/Mobi|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) ? 100 : 500;
  let mySparticles = new Sparticles(myElement, { density: density }, 400);
```

# why "Sparticles" ?
```
particles + [ speed ‚ö° | snow ‚ùÑ | sparkles ‚ú® | stars ‚≠ê ] = Sparticles üåà
```
